# Algorithm to Wizard

Converts the word "algorithm" to the word "wizard". 

### Deploy?

I've just been running `zip -r algo.zip . -x *.git*` from the directory this file is in and adding to Chrome / uploading to the Chrome store. It says it is "pending review" right now, so, we'll see.

### Is it good?

No. But it's not bad.
